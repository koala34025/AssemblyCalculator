# AssemblyCalculator
A Simple Calculator: Interpreter Version
## Features
* The calculator is built in a 8 registers and 256 bits memory simulated CPU
* It transforms expressions into assembly code and does calculations with the simulated CPU.
    * Lexical analysis -> Parsing process -> Code Generation process
* It supports many functions
    * Variable assignment
    * Assign expressions
    * Integer numbers
    * Parenthesis
    * Bitwise operators
    * Arithmetic operators
    * Unary numbers
